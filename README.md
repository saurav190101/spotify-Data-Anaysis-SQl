## 🔍 Key Insights

- Top 10 streamed tracks on both platforms
- Most popular artists with total views
- Energetic tracks filtered by energy, tempo, and loudness
- Tracks that performed better on Spotify than YouTube
- Artist-wise slicers and platform toggles for dynamic filtering

---

## 📊 Power BI Dashboard Features

- **KPI cards**: Highlighting top artist and track
- **Toggle buttons**: Switch between Spotify and YouTube views
- **Custom visuals**: Icons, bookmarks, images for each artist
- **Searchable slicers**: Filter by artist or platform
